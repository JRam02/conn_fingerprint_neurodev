## Optimising connectome fingerprinting for neurodevelopmental conditions

Authors: Jivesh Ramduny & Clare Kelly

### Overview

This study was conducted by employing the functional connectome fingerprinting approach which was originally proposed by [Finn et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4135). Recent advances in fMRI research have posited that the functional connectivity profile of an individual may act as a "fingerprint", i.e. the functional connectivity profile exhibits distinct characteristics at the individual level. Our aim is to leverage this knowledge to investigate whether examining the identifiability of connectivity fingerprints may serve as a better way to assess the reliability of functional connectivity measures. We investigate an array of factors that may affect that reliability in order to ultimately optimise functional connectivity measures to attain the long-term goal of discovering robust and reliable biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.
