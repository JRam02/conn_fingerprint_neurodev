## Optimising connectome fingerprinting for neurodevelopmental conditions

Authors: Jivesh Ramduny & Clare Kelly

### Overview

Recent advances in fMRI research have posited that the functional connectivity profile of an individual may act as a "fingerprint", i.e. the functional connectivity profile exhibits distinct characteristics at the individual level. Our aim is to leverage this knowledge to investigate whether examining the identifiability of connectivity fingerprints may serve as a better way to assess the reliability of functional connectivity measures. We investigate an array of factors that may affect that reliability in order to ultimately optimise functional connectivity measures to attain the long-term goal of discovering robust and reliable biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. We employed the functional connectome fingerprinting approach which was originally proposed by [Finn et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4135). 

### Structural & Functional Data

Structural and functional data were obtained from the openly available [Consortium for Replicability and Reproducibility (CoRR)](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/samples.html) spanning childhood to adulthood. A total of five independent datasets were used which include the New York University (NYUadu), New York University (NYUado), University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPSM), Beijing Normal University (BNU) and Southwest University (SWU). For each dataset, two resting-state scans were obtained from two imaging sessions either on the same day or after several months and years. The complete information regarding the demographic details and fMRI acquisition parameters are provided below.
